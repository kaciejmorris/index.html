<div class="content">
  <p>Once again, the U.S. is raising tariffs on imported goods, sparking debate over whether these taxes will help the economy—or hurt it. While President Trump says the goal is to bring back manufacturing jobs and make trade “fairer” for the U.S., many experts warn that the move could drive up prices and harm global trade.</p>
  <p>To understand what’s happening, it is important to look at the bigger picture: what tariffs are, why they’re used, and how this decision fits into the long history of American trade policy.</p>

  <h2>What Are Tariffs and Why Are They Going Up?</h2>
  <p>Tariffs are taxes on goods brought into the country from abroad. The idea is to make foreign products more expensive so people buy American-made alternatives. President Trump claims this will help U.S. companies grow, especially in manufacturing, and lead to more jobs. He’s also argued—falsely—that tariffs could raise enough money to replace income taxes.</p>
  <p>However, according to Professor Andrew Cohen, a history professor at Syracuse University, there are likely other reasons behind this decision.</p>
  <p>“He says that existing trade agreements are unfair because they permit other nations to tax our products more than we tax theirs,” Cohen explained. “Trump says he hopes these tariffs will pressure Canada to become part of the United States. But it’s possible that Trump has his own reasons for imposing tariffs. He enjoys forcing others to beg for mercy.”</p>

  <h2>Who Pays the Price?</h2>
  <p>Tariffs aren’t just something that affects foreign companies—they have real effects on everyday Americans. When it costs more for U.S. businesses to import goods, they often raise their prices. That means shoppers could soon pay more for things like clothes, cars, electronics, and even groceries.</p>
  <p>“In the short run, it will increase prices and probably cause a global recession, leading to unemployment. In the long run, it may eventually boost manufacturing workers,” Cohen said.</p>
  <p>Businesses that depend on imported materials are especially worried. They say higher costs will make it harder to compete, forcing them to either raise prices or cut jobs. Without the guarantee that a boost in national manufacturing will ever occur, many are skeptical about if this change is worth it.</p>

  <h2>Why Are Some Goods Taxed More Than Others?</h2>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="left">
      <p>Not all tariffs are created equal. Some industries are facing higher import taxes than others, which raises questions about political favoritism.</p>
      <p>“Protective tariffs always have differential rates because they are imposed to promote particular industries. But it’s likely that the rates reflect the businesses that are well-connected to the Republican Party or have successfully lobbied the president,” Cohen said.</p>
      <p>For example, steel and aluminum—industries that Trump has publicly supported—are getting big tariff hikes. Meanwhile, areas like tech and oil are seeing fewer changes.</p>

  <h2>A Long History of Changing Trade Policy</h2>
  <p>Tariffs have always played a role in U.S. economic history. Prior to the 1930s, tariffs fluctuated often as foreign trade increased and legislation was created. In the 1930s, rates of tariffs peaked due to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. This was intended to protect Americans from foreign competition in the early stages of The Great Depression. Following the Depression, tariffs fell drastically and remained stable until the second Trump administration when tariffs rose from 2% to 17% and are expected to continue to rise.</p>
  <iframe title="Average Tariff Rates from 1821-2025" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ptnWc" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ptnWc/1/" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0" style="border: none; width: 100%; height: 425px;" data-external="1"></iframe>

  <p>In addition to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, there were numerous pieces of legislation causing the rise or falls in tariffs. Here are some of the major moments that shaped tariff policy:</p>

  <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
  <p>Trump’s tariff strategy is part of a larger shift away from free trade toward economic nationalism. Many voters, especially in manufacturing areas, support this change. They believe past trade deals have sent too many jobs overseas. But economists say it’s not that simple.</p>
  <p>Raising tariffs may protect some industries, but it also puts stress on others. And with trading partners like China and the European Union fighting back with their own tariffs, the risk of a broader trade war is growing.</p>
  <p>As the U.S. doubles down on tariffs, the real test will be how this decision plays out for workers, businesses, and consumers. One thing is clear: the effects of this policy won’t stay at the borders—they’ll be felt in wallets across the country.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 1px solid #bbb; padding-bottom: 0.3em;">Interview Information:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Andrew Wender Cohen</strong><br>
      Professor of History at The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs<br>
      Phone: 315.443.2210<br>
      Email: awcohe01@syr.edu<br><br>
      I found professor Cohen while doing research about Professors at Syracuse who specialize in political economy which Professor Cohen does. 
      This interview was conducted over email as Professor Cohen was kind enough to answer my questions.

    <h2 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 1px solid #bbb; padding-bottom: 0.3em; margin-top: 2em;">Data Component Annotation:</h2>
    <p>
      The first interactive graph was created from the following data table. This data was very messy and many dates had to be manually input to have the correct average for each year. 
      There was also great variety in the data including information regarding which goods had higher or lower tariff rates, this data was not presently important for the creation of the graphic and had to be cleaned up and saved for additional research later on in the process.<br><br>
      This second interactive graph was created from the following data table. This data was not from a traditional data source, it was extracted by me from an article explaining which goods were going to experience the highest increases in their tariffs. 
      There were no available data sets about this information but I thought despite this it was a crucial piece of information to my story so I needed to find a way to include it regardless. 
      This information all still comes from a reliable source and it is relevant and newsworthy.
